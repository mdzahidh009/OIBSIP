        <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of A.P.J. Abdul Kalam's life:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1931</strong>- Born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, Kalam's background was one of modest means. His father, Jainulabdeen Marakayar, was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque, while his mother, Ashiamma, instilled in him strong values and a love for learning. Despite financial constraints, Kalam's hard work and intellectual curiosity shone through. He excelled in school, particularly fascinated by the world of science and its potential to solve problems.</li>
          <li><strong>1933</strong>- Kalam's dedication to academics led him to pursue a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology (later known as the Indian Institute of Technology Madras). This qualification laid the foundation for his illustrious career in scientific research and development, shaping India's future trajectory in aerospace.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1960</strong>- After graduating in 1960, Kalam joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). Here, his expertise and meticulous planning proved invaluable in propelling India's missile technology forward. He played a pivotal role in the development of the indigenous Agni missile series, a major feat that solidified India's strategic deterrence capabilities. These contributions cemented his reputation as the "Missile Man of India," a moniker he wore with pride.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1969</strong>- Kalam wasn't solely focused on military applications. Recognizing the importance of space exploration for scientific advancement and national prestige, he actively participated in the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) as well. His leadership was instrumental in developing the SLV-III rocket, a crucial stepping stone in India's spacefaring ambitions. This multi-pronged approach to scientific development showcased Kalam's well-rounded vision for India's technological prowess. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2002</strong>- Kalam's remarkable scientific achievements earned him immense respect and admiration across the nation. In 2002, he was elected as the 11th President of India, a testament to his widespread popularity. During his tenure, he transcended political affiliations and became a widely admired leader, affectionately known as the "People's President."
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2007</strong>- His leadership was characterized by humility, a scientific temperament when approaching challenges, and a strong commitment to empowering the youth. He believed that an educated and inspired younger generation was the key to India's progress. He actively interacted with students, igniting their curiosity and infusing them with a spirit of innovation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2007</strong>- Kalam's wisdom wasn't confined to the walls of the presidential palace. He penned several inspirational books, including "Wings of Fire" and "Ignited Minds," that continue to motivate young minds to dream big and chase their aspirations with unwavering determination. Even after his presidency, he remained active, interacting with the public and advocating for scientific development.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2015</strong>- In 2015, India mourned the loss of this remarkable leader. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam left behind a rich legacy as a scientist, a visionary leader, and a role model who ignited the minds of millions. His life story serves as a powerful reminder that with dedication, hard work, and a never-say-die attitude, even a young boy from Rameswaram can leave an indelible mark on the world.
